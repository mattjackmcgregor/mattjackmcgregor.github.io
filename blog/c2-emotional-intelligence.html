    <h3>Search Inside Yourself</h3>
    <p class="blog"> 
      Search Inside Yourself seems like a cool book.<br>
      I kind of already knew quite alot of what it was talking about in the first chapter, but it was good to go over it again and indepth.<br>
      It was interesting to learn about certain areas of the brain where things occur, and how the have run experiments to figure that you can actually chage<br>
      the and provide scientific evidence. I also did not know that google spend alot of time on things to do with emotional intelligence and that they have a whole <br>
      section dedicated to it! seems like they really value their team and  would be an awesome place to work!<br><br>
      I try to do abit of meditation everyday allthough sometimes I pretend that i dont have enough time when really there is always time. Everyday when I meditate it seems <br>
      to make me not overthink too much and feel like i got to do this i need to do that etc. it helps me to just forget about thinking out everything at once and just focusing on <br>
      one thing and that its alright to do that, and in the end way more productive!!
