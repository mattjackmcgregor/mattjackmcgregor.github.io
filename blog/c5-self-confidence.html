                <li>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</li>
                I think that self awareness is knowing yourself and controlling yourself, and mindfulness is almost like the practise of it
                in a way. They are both about self control and realisation of what you have, and that you can use what you have anytime and that you are in control
                of your output. Not letting your feelings dont control you you control your feelings.
                <li>ry at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</li>
                Body scan i really like. I find it helps me fully focus 100%. I think when I scan my body I notice that certain parts are I go to I'm like woah your feeling like this?
                Its like that part of my body is distracted and thinking about/acting differently to the rest of my body and isn't connectd so to speak, and I think that is why sometimes 
                I cant focus 100% because some of myself/cells are experiencing another reality to the rest in my body.
                <li>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</li>
                I've always thought like this and try to live my life by it. I often see people in my life that are controled by their feelings. They feel a certain something and then just react according
                instead of realising and controling their outputs. When you become above your feelings and realise that you are in control, you can react consciously instead of instinctivly. I do think
                that the downside of this is that you can become numb as you never genuinely feel a feeling and feel its essence. I think the goal is to be able to switch on and off from the controls.
