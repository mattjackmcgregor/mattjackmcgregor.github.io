        <h3>Time and Habbits.</h3>
        <p class="blog">
        This has been something I have been dabbling with for a few years trying to find the secret recipe for me ;).<br>
        One of the techniques I have been using on and off in my daily life since school is meditation. It works wonders for me when I up keep the<br>
        practise consistently. Even after just one session. 5 minutes or an hour. My headspace is like a picture perfect day at the beach. No wind,<br>
        perfect temperature, picture perfect waves. Stillness of time. Fully present. I definatly see how beneficial it is.<br>
         The little tomato timer thingy. Those are epic! I've never heard of 
        the word 'Pomodoro' before. I've known about similar techniques but havn't<br> trialed something like it before. I'll be interested in giving this a go
        for the tasks in each sprint. <br>I think habbits are so important! I read somewhere that your subconscious is programmed with the first 6 or so years of
        your life. And it takes <br> 60 something days to fully form a habbit. I guess to create a new habbit you have to form a habbit to keep working on your new <br>
        habbit. it's like a fractal. I need to work on getting past the first little threshold of forming a habbit. Sticking to it. They say the hardest part is<br>
         starting but I think the hardest part is like the 20% mark. Atleast I'm aware of my weakness :) <br><br>Lets get theses good habbits on form.
