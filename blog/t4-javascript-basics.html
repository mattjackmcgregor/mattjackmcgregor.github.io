            <ul>
                <li>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</li>
                Javascript has more interactiveness. With javascript it's like your bringing another entity to life in a way.
                You can create what you want to happen in a situation, and when that situation comes up, the other entity recieving 
                will make these things happen.
                <li>Explain control flow and loops</li>
                An example of a control flow would be deciding what you do in the morning. Such like when you get up, you decide to drink an amount of water
                (lets say two glasses), then you will either decide to have breakfast or leave the house based on a condition ie. what the time is.
                you could use a loop for drinking the certain amount of water, as the loop will continue running untill the condition is met. (two glasses drank).
                then once this condition is met, the loop will stop. Based on the condition (time), you will either eat breakfast, or shoot of. This is an if/else statment 
                which also is subjective to a condition just like the loop, but executes in a different fashion as it has two task to chose from instead of just one. These two could
                also be put into a larger loop which we can call morning, or day. So every new day or morning this loop of drinking so much water and then asessing the condition whether to 
                eat breakfast or leave. small tasks routines inside of a larger routine. loopseption.
                <li>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</li>
                To access data in arrays ou have to know its position the data is located inside of the array. To access data in an object, you just need to know its 'label' as such.
                You can also run a search for a label to see if a piece of data is in an object by setting up something such as a function that loops through the objects data to return a match.
                <li>Explain what functions are and why they are useful</li>
                A function preforms a task or procedure. Its like a set of instruction to follow when you call it to operate. Functions are useful as the template can be written once, and resued
                over an over when it is called upon. You can also change certain variables within the function each time so it can adapt what you are wanting, aslong as the procedure stays the same,
                otherwise you will need to write a new one to perform a differnt task.
