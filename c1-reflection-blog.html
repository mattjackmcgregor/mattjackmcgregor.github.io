    <h3>I have started phase 0!</h3>
    <p class="blog"> 
      On Monday i started with an orentation call using zoom. This was basically like a welcome/introduction of whats going to happen, what to expect, <br>
      and a chance to meet everyone and ask any questions/queries we may have. That afternoon i started working on the first sprint<br><br>
      Enspiral Dev Academy has a different view towards education. I personaly think the old education system is super outdated for the world today.<br>
      I think EDA shares similar views aswell, and are gearing up for a more future friendly way towards learning. The style of learning at EDA seems more<br>
      mentorship based. More as guides to help you self discover and take ownership of your learning, rather that regurgitation of knowledge.<br>
      The approach to other skills EDA refers to as 'soft skiils' or 'engineering empathy' is also something I love and think is nessacary. I think<br>
      that its important to also emphasize on teach skills that machines cannot learn (for now), and I love how a big part of EDA is about co operating<br>
      and being able to interact, team up, and work with humans. Human skills. Its so underrated! teaching how to think/act not what to think/act, (if that makes sense).<br>
      <br>
      Im Really looking forward to engaging and becoming apart of the Tech world. I am abit nervous when I think about how much I am going to do, but <br>
      at the same time so excited and can't wait to see myself and everyone in the cohort how far we've all come at the end :)<br>
      So i guess this is me in week 1. Im almost finished the first sprint. Heres to one step closer to my visions!
